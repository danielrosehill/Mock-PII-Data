# Mock PII Data

This repository contains a very small collection of mock data containing personally identifiable information (PII).

I created this in order to record a demonstration video showing how a popular large language model platform was allowing user uploads to remain unauthenticated on the Internet. 

For that reason, it contains a few different types of data intended each to simulate confidential data.

All of this synthetic data was generated using a large language model, and any resemblance to real people is entirely accidental.
